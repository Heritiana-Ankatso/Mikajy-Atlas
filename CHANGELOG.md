# Changelog

All notable changes to Mikajy. The format follows [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/)
and versions follow `MAJOR.MINOR` (the Android `versionName`).

## [Unreleased]

## [6.2] - 2026-11-09

### Fixed
- **Updates happen inside the app.** Tapping *Get Mikajy Free x.y* used to open the browser and download the APK there. The app now downloads it itself (progress shown on the button), checks it against the release's `SHA256SUMS.txt`, and hands it to Android's installer, which asks once and replaces the app in place; your history and settings stay. If Android has not yet allowed Mikajy Free to install apps, the button opens that one settings screen and asks you to tap again. Only GitHub hosts are ever contacted; Android refuses anything not signed with the same key. New permission: `REQUEST_INSTALL_PACKAGES` (used only for this). `android/src/com/mikajy/app/UpdateInstaller.java`.
- Updating *to* 6.2 still needs one manual download for anyone on 6.1 or older, because the old versions cannot update themselves in place.

## [6.1] - 2026-11-09

### Added
- **Answers are typeset like paper:** fractions stacked, roots with the bar over the whole radicand, raised exponents, constants first (`1 − √6`); `arg` answers too.
- **Your handwriting is replaced by the reading, in place** (as in 5.0); the ink fades and the view follows the answer.
- **Scribble to erase** works over finished readings. **Tap a symbol to correct it**: the model's runner-up readings are offered one tap at a time.
- **Retrained recogniser** (MathWriting human ink + synthetic strokes from 57 OFL fonts + habits: a 1 with a long flag, crossed 7, open 4, a 9 from the top, x as `)(`; stroke-order augmentation). On 29 finger-written samples: **31.0 % read exactly right** (token error 32.1 %), up from 27.6 % (43.8 %) in 6.0 and 3.4 % for the shipped Mikajy 5.1 model. On MathWriting test ink: 53.3 % exact (token error 9.9 %) on the expanded set that includes the new domains.
- **Functions:** `f(x) = x² + 1`, then `f(3)`, `f(1/2)`, `f(g(2))`; a line sees the definitions above it. **Probability:** `X ~ B(n, p)` / `N` / `P` / `G` / `U` / `E`, then `P(X = k)`, `P(X ≤ k)`, `P(a ≤ X ≤ b)`, `E(X)`, `V(X)`, `C(n, k)` — exact (binomial, geometric, uniform, and Poisson / exponential as `q + c·e^(−λ)`), the normal distribution marked `≈`. `web/board-core.js`, `web/prob-core.js`.
- **Differential equations:** first-order linear and separable, second-order with constant coefficients and forcing, initial conditions, `y'`, `y''`, `dy/dx`; every solution is substituted back before it is shown. `web/ode-core.js`.
- **Complex numbers:** conjugate (`\overline z`), argument (a multiple of π when it is one), exact `e^(iπk/2)`; `e^(iπ)` is now exactly `−1`.
- **Answers are typeset:** integer fractions are stacked, exponents raised, and `√2/2` no longer shows a `÷`. The board draws `~ ≤ ≥ ≠`, the prime and a bar over a conjugate.
- **Recogniser training data:** new notation, a 9 written from the top and an x written as `)(`.
- **Matrices** (exact): `det`, `|A|`, `A⁻¹`, `Aᵀ`, `Aⁿ`, `A+B`, `AB`, `kA`; singular or mismatched matrices are refused. **Modular arithmetic**: `a mod m`, `aᵇ mod m` without forming `aᵇ`, `gcd`, `lcm`; **congruences**: `a ≡ b (mod m)` → True/False, `ax ≡ b (mod m)` → `x ≡ r (mod m')`, or `S=∅`. `web/linalg-core.js`, `web/modular-core.js`, `web/latex-eval.js`, `tests/latex-eval.test.cjs`.
- **Matrices look like they do on paper:** a bracketed grid (square, round or bars) whose brackets grow with the entries, entries aligned in columns and rows, stacked fractions allowed inside entries; answers are drawn the same way. Matrix readings no longer print their environment name (`bmatrix`) on the board.

## [6.0] - 2026-11-08 — Mikajy Free

### Recogniser (retrained)
- The stroke-sequence model was retrained on synthetic font strokes plus **MathWriting** human ink (CC BY-NC-SA 4.0; 45k expressions filtered to what the calculator understands; weights `web/model/seq1-research.json`, CC BY-NC-SA 4.0).
  Measured on 1,037 held-out MathWriting expressions (tablet / stylus ink): **60.0 % read exactly right** (token error 8.2 %), up from 49.3 % for the first MathWriting run on the same set; fractions 62.7 %, fractions inside fractions 53.3 %.
- **Honest limit:** on 29 of the owner's own finger-written samples only **27.6 % are read exactly right** (token error 43.8 %). The model reads stylus ink much better than finger ink; a 30-minute finger-style fine-tune was tried and did not clearly help (31.0 % on those 29, but worse on MathWriting), so it is not shipped. Expect misreads with finger writing; tap a symbol to correct it.

### Mikajy Free is now its own project
- **Moved and renamed.** What was *Mikajy Max* (branch `max-edition` of ARHeritiana/Mikajy, tags `max-vX.Y`) is now **Mikajy Free**, repository Heritiana-Ankatso/Mikajy-Free. New name, new logo (`branding/make_free_icon.py`, a FREE plaque), new application id `com.mikajy.app.free` (share authority `com.mikajy.app.free.share`); it still installs next to Mikajy and never replaces it. The licence (PolyForm Noncommercial 1.0.0; weights CC BY-NC-SA 4.0) and the whole history came along.
- **Updates** now follow this repository's *latest release* (plain `vX.Y` tags), as in Mikajy; the `max-v` pre-release channel is gone. Release notes start with the non-commercial notice and credits (`.github/release-notes-free.md`). Signed APKs may be committed under `releases/`.

### Added
- **Menu in three tabs** — *Actions* (history, copy, share, memory, clear), *Math* (results exact/decimal, angles, ℝ/ℂ, instant/on demand) and *App* (language, theme, updates) — instead of one long sheet. The rarely useful *Mixed* result format and the *Classic* recogniser are hidden unless they were already selected.
- **English / Français** (App → Language; follows the device language until chosen): the whole interface, toasts, the update texts and calculator words (`True/Vrai`, `unsupported/non géré`, `undefined/indéfini`). `web/i18n.js`, `tests/i18n.test.cjs`.
- Font: the Caveat subset in `web/fonts/hand.woff2` was regenerated (OFL, same weight, no Reserved Font Name) to include French accents; `tests/build_check.py` now fails if an interface string uses a character the font lacks.
- **Symbolic first:** irrational results show their closed form with the decimal second (`√8` → `2√2 ≈2.828…`, `sin(π/4)` → `√2/2`), and irrational equation roots show radicals (`x²=2` → `±√2`) when the CAS form matches the certified numeric roots. The default number format is now exact (`frac`); `dec` still gives decimals.
- **`4 = 2` is `False`** (and `4 = 4`, `1/3+1/6 = 1/2`, `√2·√2 = 2` are `True`): statements about constants are decided exactly, or symbolically, never by rounding.
- **Periodic equations:** `sin x = 0` → `x = nπ, n ∈ ℤ`; every family is verified by substituting several integers `n`.
- **Calculus engine** (`web/calculus.js`, bundled Nerdamer, Apache-2.0): derivatives, antiderivatives, definite integrals and limits, each audited against an independent numeric check of the original expression (finite differences, differentiating the answer back, Gauss–Legendre quadrature with a divergence guard, one-sided limits). The recogniser does not emit `∫`/`lim` yet, so this is an API (`Calculus.*`, `Calculator`) without handwriting input.
- `tests/calculus.test.cjs`.
- **Research licensing:** this project is under PolyForm Noncommercial 1.0.0 (code) and CC BY-NC-SA 4.0 (research weights) so it can be trained on non-commercial datasets and shared free of charge; see `docs/FREE.md`.
- **Stroke-sequence recogniser** (default; Settings → Recogniser, Classic still available): a transformer reads all the strokes of a line and emits LaTeX tokens — late additions, extended lines, multiple lines, exponents, denominators, matrices, complex numbers and `mod` are read without grouping rules. Ink stays on the board with the typeset reading and answer below it. `web/seq-core.js`, `web/model/seq1.json`, `training/{strokefeat,seqmodel,gen_corpus,train_seq,eval_seq,pack_seq,parity_seq}.py`, `tests/seq-core.test.cjs`, `tests/browser_seq.py`. Trained on synthetic strokes only.
- `training/eval_app.py --rec`, a recorded-clock replay and a viewport that contains all the ink.
- **ℝ / ℂ number domain** (Settings → Numbers): complex arithmetic with exact Gaussian rationals, all complex roots of polynomial and rational-function equations (`complexRoots` in `poly-core.js`), `tests/complex.test.cjs`.
- **Licence changed from GPL-3.0-or-later to MIT.**
- **Maths engine:** `web/poly-core.js` — exact polynomials and rational functions over ℚ and certified real-root finding
  (Sturm sequences, exact bisection). Equations in `x` now return *every* real root for polynomials up to degree 32
  and for fractions with `x` in the denominator (excluded points are removed). `|u|` and even powers invert to both branches.
- Exact trigonometric values at 30°/45°/60°/90° and their `π` multiples (`sin 30°=0.5`, `tan 45°=1`, no `≈`); decimal
  arithmetic uses the exact rational (`0.1+0.2=0.3`).
- Licensing documentation: `docs/LICENSING.md`, `THIRD_PARTY_NOTICES.md`, `licenses/OFL-Caveat.txt`.
- Synthetic handwriting generator (`training/synth/`, `training/generate.py`) and an offline data-collection page (`tools/collect/`).
- Trainer: `MIKAJY_ASSETS` directory, `--no-mnist`, `--cursive` (ligature-stroke augmentation) and `training/eval_model.py`.

### Changed
- Fixed: `×` inside an exponent was read as the variable x, and two roots closing on the same symbol lost a bracket.
- Synthetic generator: `+`, `×` and `x` are now drawn with two strokes most of the time (the font tracer drew them in one).
- `sin(30°)`, `sin(180°)` and similar now display exactly instead of `≈0.5` / `≈0`.
- `x⁴=16`, `|x|=2`, `x²/(x−1)=0` are solved instead of refused.

## [5.0] - 2026-11-07

### Added
- **Automatic update check.** The Android shell asks GitHub for the newest published release (at most once a day,
  only when online, switchable in Settings) and shows a dot on the menu button plus a *Get Mikajy x.y* entry.
  Nothing about the user or device is sent; the WebView itself stays offline. `INTERNET` is the only permission.
- **Exponentials and powers:** `e^x`, `e^(2x)`, `e^-1`, `10^-3`, exponents of brackets and of lower-case letters
  (the x-height `e` used to defeat the exponent detector), and a cursive `e` read as `c`/`o` before an exponent.
- **Cursive function names.** A word written in one pen-down (`sin`, `ln`, `cos`) is cut into letters at its
  ligatures by scoring every segmentation with the recogniser's own confidence; look-alike letters (`5`→`s`,
  `1`→`i`) are accepted inside words. New words: `exp`, `sqrt`, `cot`, `sec`, `csc`.
- **Maths engine:** `exp`, `sqrt`, `cot`, `sec`, `csc`; `sin2x`/`sin2π` read as `sin(2x)`/`sin(2π)`;
  exact rational powers (`8^(2/3)=4`, `4^(1/2)=2`); exact `e^0`, `ln 1`, `ln e`, `log 10`;
  equations with one `x` solved by exact inversion: `2^x=8`, `e^x=5`, `ln x=1`, `√(x+1)=3`, `5/x=2`, `x³=8`.
  Non-injective forms (`sin x=0`, `x⁴=16`, `|x|=2`) are still refused rather than answered with one "principal" value.
- Recogniser heuristics moved into a tested, DOM-free module (`web/recognizer.js`).
- Professional repository layout: docs, contribution and security policies, issue/PR templates, Dependabot,
  `package.json` scripts, wider CI (stroke-level end-to-end test, update-UI test, Java parser test).

### Changed
- Package metadata: `versionName` 5.0, `versionCode` 15.
- The multiplication-shaped glyph is now accepted as the first symbol of an exponent (`e^x`), which the old
  rule never allowed.

### Security
- The release-link guard exists twice (Java and JavaScript) and accepts only `https://github.com/Heritiana-Ankatso/Mikajy-Free/releases/…`.
- Update answers and the stored update record are re-validated field by field before use.

## [4.5] - 2026-11-07
Initial public release of the audited offline calculator. See [docs/AUDIT.md](docs/AUDIT.md).
